# MyPowerPlatformProjects
IT Help Desk Solution using Microsoft Power Platform:

The end-to-end IT Help Desk project using Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI â€“ empowering IT teams to manage support tickets seamlessly and with real-time visibility.

What I built:

-> A user-friendly Power App to raise and track IT support tickets.
-> Automated workflows using Power Automate to assign tickets, send notifications, and update status.
-> Interactive Power BI dashboards for management to monitor KPIs like ticket trends, resolution time, and team performance.

Excited to keep building solutions that make IT operations smarter and faster...!
